# Predicting Diabetes
A Comparative Analysis of Logistic Regression and Multilayer Perceptrons to Predict the Onset of Diabetes Mellitus.

This project began as a research submission for our class IBEHS 4QZ3 - Modelling of Biological System at McMaster University. 

In this project, we investigate the Pima Indians diabetes database, a collection of medical information
gathered from the Pima Indians of Arizona, USA. This population has been under continuous study since
1965 by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) as they have
been disproportionately affected by Type 2 diabetes [5,6,7]. The data includes measures of blood glucose,
insulin, body mass index, age, and diabetes status for each patient. The Pima Indians dataset can provide
insights into the relationship between the risk factors for diabetes and the prevalence of the disease in this
population. This dataset provides a well-validated data resource that we can use to understand the onset of
diabetes, leading to better outcomes in prevention and treatment in this population. Diagnosing diabetes
early can reduce the risk of diabetes-related health complications and save on medical costs. We compare
the use of two supervised machine learning algorithms, logistic regression and neural networks, to predict
the onset of Type 2 diabetes within the Pima Indian sample population. The performance of each binary
classification algorithm is analyzed to determine the one with the best accuracy, precision, recall and
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.
